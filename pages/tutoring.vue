      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Experience</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-200">I have been offering private tuition since 2021, and have volunteered teaching maths in South America, as well as assisting in Math Circles run by the University. I have also spent two years coordinating and tutoring in the MathPals program, bringing first year university maths students up to speed with the course content.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">Approach to Tutoring</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-200">I tailor my tutoring to the individual needs of my students, focusing on basic principles, routine processes, and higher level problem-solving techniques. I encourage questions and strive to create a comfortable environment, which I think is necessary to garner a confidence and a deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts.</p>
