      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Edinburgh Tutor</h1>
      <p>I am a PhD student studying Algebraic Geometry, offering tuition for SQA National 5 and Higher, delivered in person or online.</p>
      <p>Learn mathematical problem-solving and st  rengthen your existing skills, helping you transition to a higher educational level. Special introductory rate of Â£20 for an hour-long session.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl mt-4">Experience</h3>
      <p>I have been offering private tuition since 2021, and have volunteered teaching maths in South America, as well as assisting in Math Circles run by the University. I have also spent two years coordinating and tutoring in the MathPals program, bringing first year university maths students up to speed with the course content.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl mt-4">Approach to Tutoring</h3>
      <p>I tailor my tutoring to the individual needs of my students, focusing on basic principles, routine processes, and higher level problem-solving techniques. I encourage questions and strive to create a comfortable environment, which I think is necessary to garner a confidence and a deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts.</p>
