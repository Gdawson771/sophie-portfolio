    title: "Positivity and Integrality of Mirror Maps",
    date: "May 2024",
    source_url: "The_positivity_and_integrality_of_mirror_maps",
    summary: "This paper explores the application of mirror maps to reflexive polytopes in Algebraic Geometry and Quantum Physics, revealing that these maps generate power series with integer coefficients, and examines a variant map producing series with positive integers, a surprising result given their polynomial rational coefficient origins."

    title: 'Discrete Morse theory',
    date:'Summer 2023',
    src: 'Morse_Theory',
    summary: 'This paper, developed during a 2023 summer project with Dr. Jeff Hicks, presents a combinatorial proof that the square of the differential is zero in simplicial complexes. Key concepts include differential definition and sign assignment within a simplicial complex. The findings were shared at the IMA TMT conference, and the presentation is available online.'},
  { 
    title: 'Brace theory',
    date: 'Winter 2022',
    src: 'The_Study_Of_Braces_And_The_Yang_Baxter_Equation',
    summary: 'My fourth year group project was supervised by Prof Agata Smoktunowicz, who is a delight to work with. Braces are algebraic objects like rings, except instead of multiplication we have adjoint multiplication, which is a noncommutative operation. The paper discusses the set theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, and Jacobson radical rings, and how these objects correspond to braces.'

  { 
    title: 'Coxeter groups',
    src: 'Coxeter_Groups',
    date: 'Winter 2023',
    summary: 'This project was the final assessment for the representation theory of the symmetric group reading course. A Coxeter group is an object in representation theory generated by some set of reflections on a vector space. The reading course was supervised by Dr Pavel Safronov, who was very happy to supervise both of the reading courses I took during my undergraduate degree, and would recommend studying his courses or participating in one of his reading courses if you get the chance.',

    title: 'Covering spaces of the figure of eight',
    src: 'Covering_Spaces_Of_The_Figure_Of_Eight',
    date: 'Summer 2021',
    summary: 'Over the summer of 2021, I dipped my toe into the world of Algebraic Topology, where I studied the covering spaces of the figure of eight in an unpaid summer project supervised by Prof Jon Pridham. To my delight, I managed to sneak in my hobby of celtic knots into the research, and shared my findings on the Chalkdust magazine, which you can read at: https://chalkdustmagazine.com/features/covering-infinity/',
